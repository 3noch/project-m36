{-
The "m36v1" file at the top-level of the destination directory contains the the transaction graph as a set of UUIDs referencing their parents (1 or more)
Each Transaction is written to it own directory named by its UUID. Partially written transactions UUIDs are prefixed with a "." to indicate incompleteness in the graph.

Persistence requires a POSIX-compliant, journaled-metadata filesystem.
